/*
    Fallback function is a special function available to a contract. It has following features âˆ’

    It is called when a non-existent function is called on the contract.
    ---> It is required to be marked external.
    ---> It has no name.
    ---> It has no arguments
    ---> It can not return any thing.
    ---> It can be defined one per contract.
    ---> If not marked payable, it will throw exception if contract receives plain ether without data.
    Following example shows the concept of a fallback function per contract.


    Use 
    1) to resieve ether
    2) when we call a non-existent function 

    if you want that someone send ether to your fallback function, you need to use --> payable,
    and the opposite not to use this word if you don't want someone sends you ether
